# UDACITY_CharityML



# Finding Donors Project

Investigated factors that affect the Probability of charity donations being made based on real census data. Developed a naive classifier to compare testing results to. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on preprocessed census data to predict the Probability of donations. Selected the best model based on accuracy, a modified F-scoring metric, and algorithm efficiency.

See my implementation and report [here](https://github.com/Loaisherbiny/UDACITY_CharityML/blob/main/finding_donors.ipynb).

## Project Brief

In this project, We will apply supervised learning techniques on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (not-real charity organization) identify people most likely to donate. We will first explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, We will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. We will then evaluate several supervised learners of your choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, We will optimize the model you've selected and present it as your solution to CharityML. Finally, We will explore the chosen model and its predictions, to see just how well it's performing considering the data it's given.

## Evaluation

My project was evaluated against the [Finding Donors for CharityML project rubric.](https://github.com/robertyoung2/Finding-Donors-for-CharityML/blob/master/Finding%20Donors%20for%20CharityML%20project%20rubric.pdf).
